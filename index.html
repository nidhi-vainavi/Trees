    <p>I think that I shall never see <br />A poem lovely as a tree</p>
    <p>
      A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed <br />
      Against the Earth's sweet flowing breast;
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      A tree that looks at God all day <br />And lifts her leafy arm to pray;
    </p>
    <p>
      A tree that may in summer wear <br />
      A nest of Robins in her hair;
    </p>
    <p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain; <br />Who intimately lives with rain.</p>
    <p>Poems are made by fools like me, <br />But only God can make a tree</p>
